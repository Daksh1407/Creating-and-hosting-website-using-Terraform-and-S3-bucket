# Project Title: AWS & Terraform Website Deployment

## Abstract:
This project demonstrates the integration of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Terraform for automating the deployment of a static website using an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. By leveraging Terraform's infrastructure as code capabilities, the project showcases the streamlined provisioning of resources, emphasizing consistency and repeatability in cloud deployments.

## Introduction:
In this project, we explore the collaborative potential of AWS and Terraform in deploying a static website infrastructure. The focus is on creating an S3 bucket for hosting the website, configuring essential settings, and utilizing Terraform scripts for automation. By navigating the AWS ecosystem and employing infrastructure as code principles, we aim to provide a practical guide for efficient cloud infrastructure management.

## Implementation:
1. **AWS Setup**: Create an AWS account, configure IAM permissions, and set up EC2 instances.
2. **Terraform Configuration**: Write Terraform scripts to define infrastructure components.
3. **Provision AWS Resources**: Run Terraform commands to provision resources.
4. **Website Deployment**: Upload website code to GitHub, configure EC2 instances.
5. **DevOps Integration**: Integrate Git with Jenkins for automation.
6. **Testing**: Implement automated testing scripts for website functionality.
7. **Documentation**: Document setup, configurations, and procedures for reference.

## Installation Steps:
1. **AWS Account Setup**:
   - Create an AWS account at [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/).
   - Configure IAM (Identity and Access Management) permissions for your account.

2. **Terraform Installation**:
   - Download and install Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
   - Verify the installation by running `terraform -v` in your terminal.

3. **Git Setup**:
   - Install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or via package manager.
   - Configure Git with your username and email using `git config`.

4. **GitHub Repository Setup**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub to store your project code.
   - Initialize a Git repository locally using `git init` and connect it to your GitHub repository.



## Conclusion:
By seamlessly integrating AWS and Terraform, this project emphasizes the transformative impact of automation in cloud infrastructure management. It serves as a practical guide for navigating AWS and Terraform, contributing valuable insights to cloud computing practices.
